## Course Support

One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Class Forum (https://forum.linuxfoundation.org/categories/lfd259-class-forum). The forum can be used in the following ways:

To introduce yourself to other peers taking this course.
To discuss concepts, tools and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course materials.
To ask questions or report issues with labs or course content.
To share resources and ideas related to Kubernetes.
The Class Forum will be reviewed periodically by the Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource, not an 'ask the instructor' service.

If you have questions regarding your course enrollment, you can reach out to us via our Customer Support system (https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/15). You will be required to login with your LF Account, which will help us to quickly locate your account and respond to your request. This will also allow you to track your support request through to resolution, and create an ongoing record of your support requests.

The Linux Foundation Training & Certification Customer Support system also offers enhanced functionality, such as:

Knowledge Base Articles - to help you find a quick response to your commonly asked questions
Service Request Forms - asking the right questions so that you can get the right answers.

## Course Timing

This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you registered, even after you have completed the course.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread your own path through the material.

## Course Formatting

In order to make it easier to distinguish the various types of content in the course, we use the color coding and formats below:

Dark blue: Text typed at the command line

Green: Output

Black: File content

Brown: File/Directory names

Light blue: Hyperlink
