## The Linux Foundation

The Linux Foundation is the world’s leading home for collaboration on open source software, hardware, standards, and data. Linux Foundation projects are critical to the world’s infrastructure, including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, ONAP, PyTorch, RISC-V, SPDX, OpenChain, and more. The Linux Foundation focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of contributors, users, and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration. The Linux Foundation has registered trademarks and uses trademarks. For a list of trademarks of The Linux Foundation, please see its trademark usage page.

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open source software foundation under the Linux Foundation umbrella dedicated to making cloud native computing universal and sustainable. Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. Cloud native technologies enable software developers to build great products faster.

CNCF serves as a vendor-neutral home for many of the fastest-growing projects on GitHub, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy, fostering collaboration between the industry's top developers, end users and vendors.

## The Linux Foundation Events

Over 85,000 open source technologists and leaders worldwide gather at Linux Foundation events annually to share ideas, learn and collaborate. Linux Foundation events are the meeting place of choice for open source maintainers, developers, architects, infrastructure managers, and sysadmins and technologists leading open source program offices, and other critical leadership functions.

These events are the best place to gain visibility within the open source community quickly and advance open source development work by forming connections with the people evaluating and creating the next generation of technology. They provide a forum to share and gain knowledge, help organizations identify software trends early to inform future technology investments, connect employers with talent, and showcase technologies and services to influential open source professionals, media, and analysts around the globe.
